I also want to work on this project.  I think it will be an interesting project that has potential to be very helpful and will have some cool features.  
I think the Business and Legal plans sound great, the product can be accessable, but of course the data stored for each user should be private.  I am also glad we'd be using Javascript and mongoDB since I am familiar with those.  
I am willing to contribute in any way needed, I hope we can split up the work evenly so that we can work effectively.
